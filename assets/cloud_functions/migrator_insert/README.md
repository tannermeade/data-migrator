## üöÄ Building and Packaging

To package this example as a cloud function, follow these steps.

```bash
$ cd your_folder_of_files
$ dart pub get
$ tar -zcvf ../../code.tar.gz .

```
* Ensure that your folder structure looks like this 
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .appwrite/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pubspec.lock
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pubspec.yaml
```

* Create a tarfile

```bash
$ cd ..
$ tar -zcvf code.tar.gz storage_cleaner
```

* Navigate to the Overview Tab of your Cloud Function > Deploy Tag
* Input the command that will run your function (in this case `dart main.dart`) as your entrypoint command
* Upload your tarfile 
* Click 'Activate'

## ‚è∞ Schedule

Head over to your function in the Appwrite console and under the Settings Tab, enter a reasonable schedule time (cron syntax).

For example:

- `*/30 * * * *` every 30 minutes
- `0 * * * *` every hour
- `0 0 * * *` every day
